# Garbage-Classification
This is a project for garbage classification. The classification standard used mainly focuses on recyclable trash, 
including 6 classes: metal, paper, cardboard, glass, plastic, and other trash. The system is based on ResNet102V2, using cyclic learning rate optimization. Also, there is a simple visiualized interface that allows to choose a local picture to perform classifying.
